- Reason: Fix build error by properly configuring dynamic rendering at the layout level.

## Tailwind CSS Styling Fix (Local Environment)

- **Problem:** Local dev environment (`npm run dev`) failed to apply Tailwind CSS. Unprocessed `@tailwind` directives appeared in served CSS, while direct Tailwind CLI builds worked. This pointed to an issue in the Next.js CSS pipeline on the specific machine.
- **Resolution:**
    1.  Standard troubleshooting (config verification, cache clearing, Node.js version check).
    2.  **Key Fix - PostCSS Configuration Adjustment:**
        - Renamed `postcss.config.mjs` (ESM) to `postcss.config.js` (CommonJS).
        - Explicitly added `tailwindcss: {}` and `autoprefixer: {}` to `plugins` in `postcss.config.js`.
        - Installed `autoprefixer` as a dev dependency.
    3.  This resolved the issue, and styles loaded correctly after clearing `.next` and restarting the dev server.
- **Suspected Cause:** Conflict or misinterpretation of the ESM `postcss.config.mjs` or Tailwind's implicit autoprefixer within the local Next.js dev setup.
- **Preventative Measure:**
    - Added `tests/check-tailwind-build.js` script.
    - This script runs a production build (`npm run build`) and checks the output CSS in `.next/static/css` for unprocessed `@tailwind` directives, aiming to catch similar issues early.

### Previous Changes
// ... existing code ...

## AKOOL Avatar Integration - Phase 1: Backend and Service Setup

- **Installed `agora-rtc-sdk-ng`:** Added the necessary Agora SDK for AKOOL video avatar functionality.
- **Created AKOOL Token API Route (`src/app/api/akool-token/route.ts`):** Implemented a secure backend API route to fetch AKOOL access tokens using Client ID and Secret stored in `.env.local`. This keeps sensitive credentials off the client-side.
- **Developed `ApiService` (`src/services/apiService.ts`):** Created a TypeScript class to encapsulate interactions with the AKOOL API. This service includes methods for creating/closing sessions, and listing available languages, voices, and avatars, providing a structured way to call AKOOL endpoints.
- **Added `AkoolAvatar.tsx` placeholder:** Created an initial placeholder component for the avatar display.
- **Added `akool-test/page.tsx`:** Created a test page for isolated testing of the AKOOL avatar integration.
- **Configured `vercel.json`:** Added a `vercel.json` file with basic Next.js configuration and permissive headers (including Content-Security-Policy) to facilitate Vercel deployment.

## AKOOL Avatar Integration - Phase 2: Isolated Test Page Implementation

- **Avatar Listing & Session Creation:** 
  - Modified `src/app/akool-test/page.tsx` to use `ApiService` to fetch and display a list of available AKOOL avatars.
  - Implemented functionality to create a live avatar session with a selected avatar, retrieving Agora credentials (`appId`, `channel`, `token`, `uid`).
- **Agora RTC Integration for Video/Audio:**
  - Dynamically imported `agora-rtc-sdk-ng` to avoid SSR `window is not defined` errors.
  - Implemented Agora client setup to join the specified channel using the fetched credentials.
  - Handled `user-published` events to subscribe to and play the remote avatar's video and audio tracks, rendering the live video in a designated player div.
  - Added cleanup logic to leave the Agora channel when the session ends or the component unmounts.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Functionality:**
  - Added an input field and send button to the test page.
  - Implemented `handleSendText` to construct the required JSON payload (with `type: "chat"` and text) and send it to the avatar via `agoraClient.sendStreamMessage()`.
  - The avatar now speaks the sent text, and lip-sync is visible.
- **Chat Display & UI/UX Refinements:**
  - Implemented a basic chat log on the test page to display user-sent messages and text responses received from the avatar via `stream-message`.
  - Added state (`hasVideoStarted`) and styling to improve the video player UI (hiding "Waiting for video..." message after video starts, centering video).
- **Error Handling & Debugging:**
  - Addressed and resolved React duplicate key warnings in the chat log by ensuring uniquely generated keys (`window.crypto.randomUUID()`) for both user and bot messages, especially handling the case where the bot echoes back the user's message ID.
  - Added `// @ts-ignore` for a persistent linter error related to `sendStreamMessage` type definitions, assuming runtime correctness.
  - Resolved linter errors related to potentially null Agora client instances after dynamic import by adding appropriate guards and checks.
  - Added detailed console logging for various states and IDs to aid debugging.

## UI Refinements and Basic Scripted Checks

- **Fractional Star Rating:** Modified the `StarRating` component in `src/components/ChatModal.tsx` to accurately display fractional star ratings (e.g., 4.4 stars will show the 5th star 40% filled) using a foreground/background star clipping technique.
- **Consistent ChatModal Sizing:** 
  - Removed `scale-[0.9]` transform from `ChatModal.tsx` to ensure it renders at its natural size.
  - Adjusted the `ChatModal` width to `w-[360px]` and set a fixed height of `h-[600px]` to ensure consistent sizing across environments and prevent layout issues caused by short initial content.
- **Introduced Script-Based Source Code Checks:**
  - Created `tests/check-chat-modal.js` to perform basic static checks on `src/components/ChatModal.tsx`:
    - Verifies the presence of critical Tailwind CSS sizing classes (`w-[360px]`, `h-[600px]`).
    - Checks that `localStorage.getItem('chatbotState')` is accessed within a `typeof window !== 'undefined'` guard.
  - Added an npm script `test:scripts` to `package.json` to run both `tests/check-tailwind-build.js` and `tests/check-chat-modal.js` with a single command.
- **Testing Plan Discussion:** Outlined a high-level testing strategy, recommending:
  - Unit/integration tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library (RTL), focusing on render checks and basic interactions.
  - End-to-end (E2E) smoke tests with Playwright or Cypress for critical user flows.
  - Continued use of TypeScript and ESLint for static analysis.

## ChatModal.tsx Video Overlay & Styling Refinements

- **AKOOL Avatar Integration into `ChatModal.tsx`:**
  - Modified `ChatLauncher.tsx` to fetch AKOOL token and create session, passing `akoolSession` data to `ChatModal`.
  - Integrated Agora SDK logic (dynamic import, client setup, event handlers for video/audio/TTS) directly into `ChatModal.tsx`.
  - Added logic to `sendMessage` in `ChatModal.tsx` to route TTS to AKOOL if a session is active, falling back to the existing backend agent otherwise.
  - Resolved "avatar busy" error by updating `DEFAULT_AVATAR_ID` to a known working ID.
  - Re-enabled logic to close AKOOL sessions when the modal is closed.
- **Visual Styling for Video Overlay:**
  - **Dynamic Video Player Sizing:** The video player in `ChatModal.tsx` was styled to display underneath the header by dynamically measuring the header's height using a `ref` and adjusting the video player's `top` and `height` CSS properties accordingly.
  - **Message Bubble Styling:**
    - User message bubbles styled with a blue-to-purple gradient (`bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500/[.90] to-purple-500/[.90]`).
    - Agent message text color changed to `text-black` for better contrast on the video.
    - User message timestamps styled with `text-white/90`.
    - Main text content (via `ReactMarkdown`) within user messages conditionally styled `text-white`.

## ChatModal.tsx Structural Refactor and Clear Zone for Avatar

- **Component Refactoring:** `ChatModal.tsx` was refactored by extracting its main UI sections into four conceptual sub-components (defined within the same file):
  - `ChatHeader`: Displays agent info, social links, and close button.
  - `ChatBody`: Manages the display of messages and the visual space for the video.
  - `TimerSection`: Handles quick replies, countdown offers, and savings progress.
  - `MessagingInput`: Contains the text input and send button.
- **Persistent Clear Zone for Avatar:**
  - **Objective**: Ensure the top part of the video avatar (where the face is) remains unobstructed by chat messages, even when scrolling.
  - **Implementation in `ChatBody`:**
    - The overall `ChatModal` height was adjusted (initially to 750px, then to 675px).
    - The `ChatBody` was structured with a two-part layout using flexbox:
      1.  A **static, non-scrollable clear zone div** at the top with a fixed height (initially 280px, then 200px, finalized at 180px).
      2.  A **scrollable message list div** below it, taking up the remaining vertical space.
    - The global video player (`id={AKOOL_PLAYER_ID}`) was positioned absolutely behind all `ChatModal` content sections (header, body, timer, input), filling the space below the header.
- **Vanishing Effect for Messages:**
  - To create a smoother transition where messages appear to fade out at the top of the scrollable area (entering the clear zone), a CSS `mask-image` was applied to the scrollable messages container.
  - The mask uses a `linear-gradient` (e.g., `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.7) 20px, black 40px)`) to transition the message visibility from fully transparent at the top edge of the scrollable area to fully opaque over a 40px distance, with an intermediate step for a smoother easing effect.

## Chat Loading Sequence and Avatar Handling of Session Timeouts

*   **Improved Chat Loading Sequence & Visual Transitions:**
    *   Addressed issues causing infinite loading screens or jarring intermediate visual states (e.g., white/black screen flashes) when loading the Akool video avatar.
    *   Iteratively refined state management for loading screens between `ChatLauncher.tsx` and `ChatModal.tsx`.
    *   The final approach involves `ChatLauncher.tsx` handling the initial session creation loading. Once a session is established, `ChatModal.tsx` renders and manages its own full-modal loading screen (`AvatarLoadingScreen` controlled by the `isAvatarBuffering` state).
    *   This internal `ChatModal.tsx` loading screen persists until the Agora video track's 'first-frame-decoded' event fires, ensuring a direct and smooth transition from loading to the visible video avatar.

*   **Graceful Handling of Avatar Session Timeouts:**
    *   Implemented a "Session Ended" overlay in `ChatModal.tsx` to address the avatar video feed going black after a period of inactivity (due to Akool session timeout, e.g., 5 minutes).
    *   A new state, `showSessionEndedOverlay`, controls the visibility of this overlay.
    *   The overlay is triggered when the Agora video track is unpublished (`handleUserUnpublished` event for video).
    *   It informs the user that the session has ended (e.g., due to inactivity) and provides a "Close Chat" button to allow them to restart the session by reopening the chat.
    *   The overlay is reset when a new session starts or when a video track successfully begins playing.


## Exponential Backoff Introduced for Error Handling
- Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism in ApiService for handling AKOOL API errors
- Added automatic retries with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) when avatars are busy or network errors occur

## Added Calendar, Tasks and Contacts View

- Switched calendar to FullCalendar for robust alignment, modern UI, and reliable scheduling (with drag-to-select only for new tours).
- Added full tour management: status updates, color coding, deletion, and sidebar details.
- Reordered navigation: Calendar now appears before Contacts in the sidebar.
- Built elegant Contacts page: table of prospects with add/delete, clickable email/phone, and status badges.
- Created Tasks page for property managers to answer user questions and train the AI, with add/answer/resolve/delete actions.
- Media Library: Now persists images in localStorage (base64, <1MB per file) so uploads remain after refresh; shows warning for oversized files.
- Numerous UI/UX improvements for consistency, clarity, and modern feel across all dashboard pages.

## Data Centralization & Code Cleanup

- **Centralized Dummy Data (`src/lib/dummy-data.ts`):**
    - Created a new file `src/lib/dummy-data.ts` to consolidate all dummy data used across the dashboard.
    - Defined interfaces: `DummyAgent`, `DummyProspect`, `DummyTour`, `DummyTask`.
    - Exported arrays of standardized dummy data: `dummyAgents`, `dummyProspects`, `dummyTours`, `dummyTasks` with consistent details and dynamic dates.
- **Dashboard Pages Refactored to Use Centralized Data:**
    - Updated the following pages to import and use data from `src/lib/dummy-data.ts` for their initial state, replacing local hardcoded data:
        - `src/app/dashboard/calendar/page.tsx` (using `dummyTours`)
        - `src/app/dashboard/contacts/page.tsx` (using `dummyProspects`, `dummyTours`)
        - `src/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx` (using `dummyTasks`)
        - `src/app/dashboard/specials/page.tsx` (using `dummyProspects`)
    - Updated components within the main Dashboard and Deep Insights sections to use centralized dummy data where names were previously hardcoded:
        - `src/app/dashboard/activity/page.tsx` (Active Agents list now uses `dummyAgents`).
        - `src/app/dashboard/components/DeepInsightsTable.tsx` (User names now from `dummyProspects`).
        - `src/app/dashboard/deep-insights/ClientRecordModal.tsx` (User names now from `dummyProspects`).
        - `src/app/dashboard/components/PreleaseTabs.tsx` (User names now from `dummyProspects`, filtered for 'leased' status).
- **Navigation Highlighting Fix & File Structure Adjustment:**
    - Addressed an issue where multiple navigation links under "Knowledge" were highlighted simultaneously.
    - Changed the route for "Knowledge Base" from `/dashboard/knowledge` to `/dashboard/knowledge/base` in `src/lib/routes.ts`.
    - Updated the `NavItem` component in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to use a strict path match (`pathname === href`) for determining active link state.
    - Moved the "Knowledge Base" page from `src/app/dashboard/knowledge/page.tsx` to `src/app/dashboard/knowledge/base/page.tsx` to align with the new route.
    - Corrected a broken import path for `KnowledgeForm` in `src/app/dashboard/knowledge/base/page.tsx` that occurred due to the file move.
- **Unused Component Cleanup:**
    - Identified and deleted the following unused UI components to maintain a cleaner repository:
        - `src/components/ui/BalloonRain.tsx`
        - `src/components/ui/ConfettiRain.tsx`
        - `src/components/ChatBox.tsx`
        - `src/components/ui/progress.tsx`
        - `src/components/ui/input.tsx`
        - `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`
    - Verification was done by searching for imports or usages of these components across the codebase.

## AKOOL Session Management Crisis Resolution & Dashboard Data Integration

### Critical AKOOL Session Bug Fix
- **Root Cause:** Token API returning `data.token` but cleanup code accessing `data.data.token` causing undefined errors
- **Fixed Token Path:** Updated `src/app/api/avatar/session/close/route.ts` to correctly access token from response
- **Session ID Tracking:** Enhanced ChatLauncher to store real session IDs in `akool-last-session-id` for targeted cleanup
- **Eliminated Complex Retries:** Replaced infinite retry loops with simple 2-attempt limit (2s/4s delays)

### Simplified Force Close System
- **Created** `src/lib/akool-force-close.ts` - Lightweight cleanup focused on localStorage clearing + specific session closure
- **Removed Complex Manager:** Deleted overcomplicated `akool-session-manager.ts` with exponential backoff and emergency controls
- **Targeted Cleanup:** Close specific problematic sessions instead of generic force-close operations
- **Page Refresh Strategy:** Aggressive session ID clearing on page load to prevent carryover issues

### Professional Loading Screen Enhancement
- **Grand Oaks Branded Interface:** Created luxury apartment loading screen with "GO" logo and professional messaging
